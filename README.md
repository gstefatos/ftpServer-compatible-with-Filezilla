FTP Server Compatible with Filezilla Client

Our FTP Server is designed to be fully compatible with the Filezilla Client. It currently supports the following commands:

    PWD - Print Working Directory. This command allows the user to view the current directory.
    CWD - Change Working Directory. This command allows the user to change the current directory.
    LIST - Lists all files and directories in the current directory.
    DELE - Deletes a specified file.
    MKD - Makes a new directory.
    RMD - Removes a specified directory.
    RETR - Retrieves a specific file.
    STOR - Stores a file on the server.
    USER - Specifies the user for login.
    PASS - Specifies the password for login.
    TYPE I - Specifies the binary mode for file transfer.
    PORT - Specifies the port for data connection.

In addition to these command support, our FTP Server also utilizes a Database for authentication of user credentials, which ensures a secure access system for all users.
